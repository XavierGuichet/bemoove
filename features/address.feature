Feature: Manage address
  In order to manage my addresses
  As a Coach or a user
  I need to be able to retrieve mine, create a new and delete them trough the API.

  # the "@createSchema" annotation provided by API Platform creates a temporary SQLite database for testing the API
  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create an address
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/books" with body:
    """
    {

    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
